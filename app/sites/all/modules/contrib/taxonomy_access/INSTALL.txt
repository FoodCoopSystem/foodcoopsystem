TO INSTALL, simply install and enable the module, in these steps.

PLEASE CHECK that you use the right version of Taxonomy Access for your 
  version of DRUPAL.

IMPORTANT: This is a complicated module. When you first learn to use this 
  module, ALWAYS TRY IT FIRST ON A TEST SITE.

NOTE: If you want to USE TWO OR MORE "ACCESS" MODULES AT THE SAME TIME, TEST 
  THEM CAREFULLY. (e.g: OG, node_privacy_by_role, taxonomy access, etc.)

TO UPDATE from previous versions of taxonomy_access: PLEASE READ UPDATE.TXT!
  WHEN UPDATING, ALWAYS disable the module first before uploading the new 
  module, on the page:
  "Administration >> Modules"
  (http://www.example.com/admin/modules).

INSTALLATION
-----------------------

1. COPY the taxonomy_access directory to your Drupal 
   installation's module directory.
   (By default: sites/all/modules/taxonomy_access/ in your Drupal directory.)

2. ENABLE THE MODULE on page: 
   "Administration >> Modules"
   (http://www.example.com/admin/modules).

3. REBUILD YOUR NODE ACCESS PERMISSIONS on page:
   "Administration >> Reports >> Status report >> Node Access Permissions"
   (http://www.example.com/admin/reports/status/rebuild).

4. GRANT ADMINISTRATORS CONTROL of Taxonomy Access on page:
   "Administration >> People >> Permissions"
   (http://www.example.com/admin/people/permissions).

   To administer Taxonomy Access, administrators must have "access 
   administration pages" checked (under "system module") and "administer 
   permissions" checked (under "user module"). 

5. CONFIGURE ACCESS GRANTS to the various categories at: 
   "Administration >> Configuration >> Taxonomy access control"
   (http://www.example.com/admin/config/people/taxonomy_access).

   Be sure to configure the authenticated role, as users with custom roles 
   also have the authenticated user role.

NOTE: DATABASE TABLES are automatically added to database. Module creates two 
   database tables: 'taxonomy_access_term' and 'taxonomy_access_default'.
