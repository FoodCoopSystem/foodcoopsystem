This module provides alternative ways of adding products to cart.

The initial version provides a views field handler ("Commerce Product: Quantity input field")
that relies on the Views Form API (a part of Views 3 since RC1) to output a quantity
textfield that turns the view into an add to cart form.
The default quantity can be configured, and only products with a quantity
larger than 0 are added to the cart.
