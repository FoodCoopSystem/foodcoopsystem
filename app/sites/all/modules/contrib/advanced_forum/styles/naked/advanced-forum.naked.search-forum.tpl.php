 * Display the search forum widget.
 *
 * The real widget is part of a view, but this widget actually leads to the
 * view, and can be redone. It does not need to use FAPI because it
 * is just a simple get form, which allows us to style it however we
 * like as long as it has the two important keys: forum and keys.
 *
 * Variables:
 * - $forum: The forum ID. Will be 'All' for no particular forum.
 * - $path: The path to the search widget for the form action.
