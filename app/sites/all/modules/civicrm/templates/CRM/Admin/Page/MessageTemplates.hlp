{htxt id="id-intro"}
<p>
{ts}Message templates allow you to save and re-use messages with layouts. You can use them when sending email to one or more contacts. If you are using the CiviMail component - you can use templates for your messages. If you are using the CiviMember component, you will need to create one or more message templates for membership renewal reminders.{/ts} {$memberTypesDocLink}
</p>

<p>
{ts}You may include tokens to represent fields (like a contact's "first name") in the message subject and body. These will be replaced with the actual value of the corresponding field in the outgoing message EXAMPLE: Dear {ldelim}contact.first_name{rdelim}.
{/ts} {$tokenDocLink}

{htxt id="id-system-workflow"}
<p>
    {ts}System workflow message templates are used to generate the emails sent to consituents and administrators for contribution receipts, event confirmations and many other workflows. You can customize the style and wording of these messages here.{/ts}
</p>
<p>
    {ts}Workflow messages include text AND necessary program logic. Use caution when editing so as not to modify the program logic. Be sure to test the workflow and review the emails sent after making any changes. If you find that your changes have caused problems, errors or missing information - you can always &quot;Revert&quot; to the system default for that workflow.{/ts}
</p>

{htxt id="id-msgTplIntro"}

These will be replaced with the actual value of the corresponding field in the outgoing message. EXAMPLE: Dear{ldelim}contact.first_name{rdelim}.
