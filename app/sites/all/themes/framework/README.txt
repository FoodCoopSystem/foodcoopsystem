Framework 3.x for Drupal 7
Created by Andr√© Griffin

Framework is a blank canvas for theme developers. 
Use Framework as a user friendly starting point to help facilitate your theme development. 
Build site themes without feeling like you have to reinvent the wheel or remove unnecessary code every time.

Framework 3 is intended to be used with the "Seven" administration theme included with Drupal 7.

Framework is actively developed and supported on my own time. If you would like to say thanks, please consider donating via:

USAGE

Install to sites/all/themes

To fully convert Framework to your own custom theme, it is encouraged that you: 
 - COPY the 'framework' directory within sites/all/themes/ and rename it as 'yourthemename' 
 - Change the filename and contents of the .info file accordingly and remove all 'packing script' info at the end of the file
 - Use find/replace in template.php to replace 'framework' with 'yourthemename' 
 - Upload and enable the theme
 - Modify as needed

To create a sub-theme based on Framework, see: http://drupal.org/node/225125
