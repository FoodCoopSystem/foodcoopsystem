FoodCoop System is an open source group ordering and billing system based on Drupal Commerce (Drupal 7) and PHP language.

Main goal of a project is build easy to install platform for (not only Polish) food cooperatives, to help manage orders, stock, tasks and members.

 First version of the system was founded in 2013 by UNDP for Warsaw Food Cooperative and was developed by Obin.org and RatioWeb.pl members.
